# selfingsim

A forward population genetic simulator for a partially selfing, constant-size
population.

This program was developed for and used in [1][manuscript]
selfing rate and locus-specific mutation rates for a partially selfing population"
(Redelings *et al*, 2015).

## Supported mating schemes
- pure hermaphroditism,
- androdioecy: hermaphrodites and males,
- gynodioecy: hermaphrodites and females.

## Model of mutations


## Dependency

The dependencies of this program are:
- [simuPOP](http://simupop.sourceforge.net) for actual simulations.
- [nose](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose) for unit-tests.

## Installation
